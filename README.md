# Q&A ChatBot with RAG Pipeline

A Flask-based Question & Answer ChatBot that implements a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using OpenAI embeddings and ChromaDB for vector storage.

## � Project Overview

This intelligent chatbot system crawls website content, processes it into searchable chunks, stores vector embeddings in ChromaDB, and provides accurate answers to user questions based on the retrieved context. The system uses a three-stage RAG pipeline:

1. **🔍 Retrieval**: Finds relevant content from the vector database based on semantic similarity
2. **📝 Augmentation**: Combines user questions with retrieved context to create enhanced prompts
3. **🤖 Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate contextually accurate responses

### Key Components:
- **Web Crawler**: Extracts clean content from websites recursively
- **Text Processing**: Chunks content using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for persistent storage and fast similarity search
- **AI Pipeline**: OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4o-mini for intelligent responses
- **REST API**: Flask-based endpoints for easy integration

## �🚀 Features

- **Web Crawling**: Automated content extraction from websites
- **RAG Pipeline**: Complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation implementation
- **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
- **Flask API**: RESTful API for chatbot interactions
- **Semantic Search**: Context-aware question answering

## 🔄 RAG Pipeline Implementation

### 1. **Retrieval (R) - Information Extraction & Storage**

#### Web Crawling (`crawling/crawl.py`)
```python
def crawl_website(url, output_dir='scraped_content'):
    # Extracts and cleans website content
    # Removes scripts, styles, and formatting
    # Saves clean text for processing
```

#### Text Chunking (`embeddings/generate_embeddings.py`)
```python
def create_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200):
    # Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain
    # Splits content into manageable chunks with overlap
    # Maintains context continuity between chunks
```

#### Embedding Generation
```python
def create_embeddings(chunks):
    # Converts text chunks to vector embeddings
    # Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
    # Creates 1536-dimensional vectors for each chunk
```

#### Vector Storage (`chroma/storage.py`)
```python
def save_context(embeddings, chunks, content_path):
    # Stores embeddings in ChromaDB with metadata
    # Maintains source tracking and chunk indexing
    # Enables efficient similarity search
```

### 2. **Augmentation (A) - Semantic Search**

#### Query Processing
```python
def semantic_search(user_prompt, collection_name="documents", n_results=3):
    # Converts user query to embedding vector
    # Performs similarity search in ChromaDB
    # Returns most relevant content chunks
```

#### Context Retrieval
```python
def query_context(query_embedding, collection_name="documents", n_results=3):
    # Searches vector database for similar content
    # Ranks results by similarity score
    # Returns relevant chunks with metadata
```

### 3. **Generation (G) - AI Response Creation**

#### Response Generation (`bot/chat.py`)
```python
def user_query(prompt):
    # Retrieves relevant context using semantic search
    # Augments user prompt with retrieved information
    # Generates contextual response using OpenAI GPT
```

```

### 4. Start the API Server
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🕷️ Steps to Run the Crawler

### Method 1: Using the API Endpoint (Recommended)

1. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # OR
   flask --app main run
   ```

2. **Make a POST request to `/crawl`:**
   ```powershell
   # Using PowerShell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:5000/crawl" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"url": "https://qualityesnad.com.sa/"}'
   ```

   ```bash
   # Using curl
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://qualityesnad.com.sa/"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/crawl
   ```

3. **Monitor the process:**
   - The crawler will extract content from the website and internal links
   - Text will be chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter  
   - Embeddings will be generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
   - Vector data will be stored in ChromaDB for fast retrieval

### Method 2: Direct Python Script

1. **Create a crawl script:**
   ```python
   from crawling.crawl import crawl_website
   from embeddings.generate_embeddings import create_chunks, create_embeddings
   from chroma.storage import save_context
   
   # Crawl website
   url = "https://qualityesnad.com.sa/"
   saved_files = crawl_website(url, depth=2)
   
   # Process all files
   all_embeddings = []
   all_chunks = []
   all_metadata = []
   
   for file_path in saved_files:
       chunks = create_chunks(file_path)
       embeddings = create_embeddings(chunks)
       metadata = [{"filename": file_path, "chunk_index": i} for i in range(len(chunks))]
       
       all_embeddings.extend(embeddings)
       all_chunks.extend(chunks)
       all_metadata.extend(metadata)
   
   # Save to ChromaDB
   save_context(all_embeddings, all_chunks, all_metadata)
   print("✅ Crawling and embedding completed!")
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python your_crawl_script.py
   ```

### Crawler Configuration Options:

- **`depth`**: How many levels deep to crawl (default: 2)
- **`delay`**: Seconds between requests (default: 1)
- **`max_links`**: Maximum links to process per page
- **`output_dir`**: Directory to save scraped content

```python
# Example with custom settings
crawl_website(
    url="https://example.com",
    depth=3,        # Crawl 3 levels deep
    delay=2,        # 2 second delay between requests
    output_dir="my_content"
)
```
